      		<h5>
      			If you are in the habit of forgetting stuff, especially the important stuff, then this might be just the thing you need. Also, if you are still using notepads or email to keep track of stuff then you could consider this service which presents a unified framework combining email, sms and voice so that managing and remembering tasks is easier.
      		</h5>
      		<h4>I am already using my phone to remind myself</h4>
      		<h5>
      			Its a good step towards remembering stuff but not quite comprehensive. Your phone is the only device from which you can access your reminders. Besides you cant get voice reminders or even email reminders using your phone.
